20220302  As a kid I wanted to be an astronaut. But fuck @jeffbezos. AMIRITE?
20220303  I'd add, "Fuck @elonmusk" but he's the kinda guy that tries to get former SEC investigators fired from their new jobs? AMIRITE @mattlevine?
20220304  In case you're [I wrote your first] wondering about my handle: my favorite @bloodhoundgang song is 'Ralph Wiggum'.
20220305  Delta Air Lines is optimistic about its prospects in 2022, cuz as @garyleff says: if nothing else, it has gotten past being synonymous with a killer of many thousands of people. I mean @boeing and the @faa only killed a few hundred people since way back in 2018, and they're still in the woods! 
20220306  When I signed up for this account on @github they asked me if was student or teacher, and I clicked teacher. I'm very proud to say that "those who can, do. those who can't, teach" is true for me. My resume would be pretty empty if I removed every "instructor" role.
